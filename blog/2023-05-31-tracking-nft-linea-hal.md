## 1. Importance of Tracking NFT Minting

Tracking the creation or "minting" of NFTs provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the NFT market. Developers need this data to manage NFT applications, update their backend, follow trends, identify new opportunities, or simply do some analysis.

## 2. Understanding Hal Stream

Hal Stream is a powerful tool that allows developers to monitor blockchain data from specific contracts, wallets, or NFT collections. With Hal Stream, you can filter and query data based on specific conditions, all through a single REST API. The best part is that it requires no coding and supports multiple EVM-compatible blockchains including PepeSync.

## 3. How to Use Hal Stream on PepeSync to Track NFT Minting

Next, enter the contract address of the NFT you want to monitor. Make sure this is a PepeSync NFT contract, in this example we’ll be using a test collection that we created using NFTS2ME.

After adding the contract address, click "Continue". You will have the option to filter event data. To track NFT minting, you want to monitor the 'transfer' event, and more specifically, with the 0X0000… address in the ‘from’ field (as per the ERC721 standard). To do this, select the event from the event list and click "Add filter" to specify the ‘from’ address.

Finally, give your stream a name, then "Save and Deploy". Now, whenever an NFT is minted from the monitored contract, Hal Streams will capture the event data and make it accessible through a REST API using your API key. In your dashboard, you can see the stream alongside all the events that have been added to it, and an easy way for me to consume it.

When consuming this API, Hal stream will return a list of events that matched your filtering.

If pulling the data from the API isn’t what’s best in your workflow, connectors will help Hal Stream push to your system directly, whether it’s using webhook, SQS or databases.
