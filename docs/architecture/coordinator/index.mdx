## The Coordinator

### What is it?

The Coordinator is PepeSync’s coordination module across a number of functions. It is also the channel through which information on the state of Ethereum comes into PepeSync, and through which information on the state of PepeSync returns to Ethereum.

### What does it do?

The Coordinator moves information internally, between different parts of PepeSync’s execution client, and externally, with other blockchains, PepeSync’s data availability stack, and the nodes syncing its own network state. In this way, **the Coordinator is PepeSync’s consensus client.**

### How does it do it?

It does these things through a highly modularized internal architecture. These various systems and requirements are broken out into their own environments, each one receiving input from the Coordinator, and returning the corresponding output back to it.
