In this guide, we'll walk you through how to send crypto directly on Twitter with the IDriss browser extension using PepeSync!

Before you begin, ensure your wallet is [configured to use PepeSync](/use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx) and [funded with Goerli ETH](/build-on-linea/use-linea-testnet/fund.md#get-test-eth-on-goerli).

## Send crypto directly on Twitter
