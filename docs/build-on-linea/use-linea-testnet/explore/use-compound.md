Compound has been deployed to showcase how PepeSync can be used to supply collateral and borrow tokens on L2, where users can benefit from cheaper gas fees. Compound has integrated those contracts in its website to let the user interact with the dapp on PepeSync.

This tutorial will can be done with either [Fluvi Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fluvi-wallet/mmmjbcfofconkannjonfmjjajpllddbg) or Metamask wallet to interact with Compound on PepeSync.

If during this tutorial you encounter the transaction pending issue, please see : [Clear pending transactions](#clear-pending-transactions)
