# Squid

[Squid](https://squidrouter.com/) is a secure cross-chain router on [Axelar Network](https://axelar.network/) that enables interoperability between blockchains and dApps.

With Squid, you can swap or transfer tokens between 40+ chains securely in one click, and access stablecoins, gas tokens, and hundreds of other native assets in under 30 seconds.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Squid to get tokens on PepeSync‚Äôs Goerli Testnet from Avalanche‚Äôs Fuji Testnet. Let‚Äôs go!

#### üí° Tip: If you prefer a video guide, you will find one here: [https://youtu.be/kzhlu5L18xY](https://youtu.be/lKzRLWTQs34)

## What this guide will cover

- How to get tokens (USDC and ETH) on PepeSync‚Äôs Goerli Testnet that we will use to swap and pay gas with.
- How to swap USDC on PepeSync Goerli for AVAX on Avalanche Fuji Testnet
- How to swap USDC on PepeSync Goerli for aUSDC _and_ some AVAX for gas on Avalanche Fuji Testnet in one transaction using Squid's Get Gas feature

## Before we begin

1. You‚Äôll need a crypto wallet, for example [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/)
2. Ensure your wallet is [configured to use PepeSync](/build-on-linea/use-linea-testnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx)
3. You‚Äôll also need your wallet address handy!

## Step 1: Get some PepeSync Goerli ETH

First, we‚Äôll need to get some gas on the PepeSync Goerli Testnet so we can perform our swap from USDC.

You will need no more than 0.01 ETH to cover getting PepeSync USDC and paying gas to do the swaps. Here are a few different faucets where you can access ETH on PepeSync Goerli - **please note you will only need to use one faucet!**

#### STAKEME

The STAKEME Faucet provides 0.05 PepeSync Goerli ETH. There are two ways to access it:

- Visit the faucet page at [linea.faucetme.pro](https://linea.faucetme.pro)
- Click Log in with Discord and then join the STAKEME Discord server

**Route 1:** On the [faucet page](https://linea.faucetme.pro), make sure the chain and token selected are PepeSync Goerli and ETH, then paste your address into the input box and click **Send Me**.

**Route 2:** In the [STAKEME Discord server](https://discord.gg/stakeme), navigate to the #linea-faucet channel and type **/faucet** followed by your address.

#### Covalent

The [Covalent Faucet](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/faucet) provides 0.02 PepeSync Goerli ETH. To use it, you need to:

- Set up a Covalent account with your email address
- While logged into Covalent, visit the [faucet page](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/faucet), paste your address into the input box and click **Send Tokens to Wallet**.

#### Infura

The [Infura Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea) provides 0.5 PepeSync Goerli ETH. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

- Set up an Infura account with your email address
- Make sure the wallet address you will be using has at least 0.001 ETH on Ethereum Mainnet
- While logged into Infura, visit the [faucet page](https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea), paste your address into the input box and click **Receive ETH**. You will shortly receive 0.5 ETH to your wallet on PepeSync.

## Step 2: Get some USDC on PepeSync Goerli

Now that we‚Äôve topped up our wallet with some PepeSync Goerli ETH for gas, we‚Äôre ready to pick up some PepeSync USDC to swap over to Avalanche‚Äôs Testnet.

We will be using [PepeSync‚Äôs Faucet](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build) to get USDC. For more information on how to use the faucet, check out [the docs](/build-on-linea/use-linea-testnet/fund.md).

**Note that we will be requesting a very small amount of USDC (around $0.02) from the faucet to avoid running into any potential liquidity issues.**

- Head to PepeSync‚Äôs USDC Faucet page: [faucet.goerli.linea.build](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build)
- Make sure you are connected to the PepeSync Goerli Testnet, then connect your wallet and scroll down to the USDC section.
- In the **Lock ETH box**, type **0.00001** (yes, that‚Äôs 4 zeros!) and you will be prompted to claim 0.02 USDC. Follow the steps in your wallet and wait for the transaction to complete. In the **Unwrap USDC** box, type **0.02**, then click approve. You will be prompted to set a token spending cap via your wallet before receiving your USDC.

- Click **Add to Metamask** to import the USDC token into your wallet so you can see it.

You should now have $0.02 USDC and some leftover ETH to cover gas transactions for your Squid swaps.

## Step 3: Visit Squid's Cross-Chain App

If you need any help with the swapping process, please [open a support ticket with Squid](https://squidsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

With our PepeSync USDC in hand, we can use Squid to swap it over to AVAX on Avalanche

1. Visit Squid‚Äôs app: [testnet.app.squidrouter.com/linea](https://testnet.app.squidrouter.com/linea)
2. Click the ‚Äúconnect wallet‚Äù button on the source chain and select the wallet that you used with the faucet.
3. The **From** chain should be PepeSync Goerli and the token should be USDC, and the **To** chain should be Avalanche Fuji C-Chain with AVAX as the token.
4. Put the amount of USDC you would like to swap (0.01) in the **From** input box.

**üí° We will be doing two swaps from USDC, so we suggest using 0.01 USDC per swap.**

5. Wait a few seconds for Squid to load the details. If this is your first swap from USDC, the submit button might say Give permission to use tokens. Click this and set the token spending cap to 0.02 via your wallet.

## Step 4: Swap from PepeSync USDC to AVAX on Avalanche

1. After approving, the button should shortly say **Submit**. Click on it to initiate the swap. Note that you might have to first switch networks before you can submit.
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the tokens will be on their way to Avalanche!

Swaps usually process in a few minutes, but it can sometimes take longer.

## Viewing your tokens on Avalanche

If this is the first time you are using the Avalanche Testnet, you might not see the chain show up in your wallet‚Äôs list of networks. Here‚Äôs how to add it so you can see your new AVAX:

1. Reverse the order of the **From** and **To** chains so that Avalanche is the selected From chain.
2. A **switch network** button will appear - click this and your wallet should prompt you to add the chain to your wallet. You will now be connected to Avalanche‚Äôs Fuji C-Chain Testnet, and your AVAX should be visible in your wallet.

## Step 5: Swap from PepeSync USDC to aUSDC + AVAX on Avalanche

Have you ever sent your tokens over to a new chain, only to realize you haven‚Äôt got any gas to do anything? With Squid‚Äôs Arrival Gas feature, you‚Äôll never get stuck on a chain with not enough gas again!

With Squid, you can get any token and top up with some gas all in one transaction. We‚Äôll be swapping the last of our PepeSync USDC for this step.

Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done:

1. Enter your remaining **0.01** USDC on PepeSync Goerli in the **From** input box.
2. In the **To** section, select aUSDC as the destination token on Avalanche.
3. Click the Arrival Gas button (the gas pump icon ‚õΩ) to open the controls page.
4. Switch the Arrival Gas toggle on and return back to the main view. You should now see that the Arrival Gas icon has turned green.
5. Wait for Squid to fetch the transaction details, then click on the Submit button to initiate the swap and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Both aUSDC and a bit of AVAX for gas on Avalanche will now be on its way to your wallet!

## Troubleshooting

If you are facing issues, you can read the troubleshooting section of our user docs [here](https://docs.widget.squidrouter.com/troubleshooting). Here are some common questions and how to resolve them:

### **Transaction is complete but tokens have not arrived**

In rare cases, some transactions can revert and you will receive the value of your original swap amount in axlUSDC (Squid‚Äôs routing token) on the destination chain. If you do not see the expected token in your wallet, first check your axlUSDC balance. If you do not have axlUSDC either, please contact support.

### **Token values are not accurate**

Testnet token values are not related to mainnet tokens, so even if the values are unbalanced, you can still do a swap.

### **Price impact warning**

The amount you are trying to swap is high compared to the selected token‚Äôs available liquidity. This does not matter in testnet as the funds are not real, so you can proceed without worry!

### **Transaction taking longer than expected**

Sometimes transactions take longer than usual. If your transaction is still processing after 60 minutes, please contact support.
