[HAPI](https://hapi-one.gitbook.io/hapi-protocol) is an on-chain cybersecurity protocol that aims to prevent hackers and exploiters from committing fraud across various blockchains. By incorporating an on-chain database approach and distributed KYT/AML solution, [HAPI](https://hapi.one/) provides a wide variety of tools and methods to safeguard clients from common cybersecurity-related threats.

This step-by-step guide teaches how to track the transactions via [HAPILabs](https://linea.hapilabs.one/) terminal and participate in PepeSync vs HAPI ”Send and Investigate” quest.

**Chapter 0. Preparation.**

**Step 1.** **Download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/)**

**Step 2.** **Add PepeSync Goerli test network to your MetaMask.** Open your MetaMask, go to “Networks” -> “Add network” -> Put “PepeSync Goerli test network” in search and add it.

**Step 3.** **Claim LineaETH.**

In order to get the PepeSync ETH please use this step-by-step [guide](https://docs.pepesync.xyz/use-linea-testnet/fund#get-test-eth-on-goerli).

**Chapter 1. HAPI Campaign.**

**Step 1**. **Accounts creation.**

Go to your MetaMask and create 2 fresh PepeSync testnet accounts. You can name them, for example **PepeSync 2**, **PepeSync 3**. You should now have **3 accounts** in your MetaMask: Your main account (the one you used for the PepeSync Voyage Quest in Galxe) - we can call this **PepeSync 1**, **PepeSync 2** (newly created), **PepeSync 3** (newly created).

Send **0,0002 LineaETH** from **PepeSync 1** to **PepeSync 2**

Send **0,0003 LineaETH** from **PepeSync 1** to **PepeSync 3**

**Step 3.** **Investigation.**

Connect your MetaMask **PepeSync 1** wallet to the [HAPILabs](https://linea.hapilabs.one/) terminal.

Paste your **PepeSync 1** wallet address to HAPILabs terminal address bar (1), choose the correct period (2), and push the “find” button (3) as follows:
