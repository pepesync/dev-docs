# Patch Wallet

[Patch Wallet](https://linea.patchwallet.com/) is a "zero onboarding" wallet attached to every Twitter account, email, and telephone number. There's no app to download, no gas, or even sign-up. Every Twitter user has a wallet automatically and can start receiving tokens and NFTs!

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to access your Patch wallet connected to your Twitter, mint an NFT, and send it to _any_ Twitter user...[Elon Musk](https://linea.patchwallet.com/twitter:elonmusk), [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://linea.patchwallet.com/twitter:cristiano), [Narendra Modi](https://linea.patchwallet.com/twitter:narendramodi) or anyone else!

**You will not need to set up a MetaMask wallet to use Patch Wallet**

**You will need an email input in your Twitter account. If not, you will not be able to complete the quest.**
