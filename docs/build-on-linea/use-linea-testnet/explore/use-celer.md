# Celer

[Celer cBridge](https://dev-cbridge-v2.netlify.app/97/59140/BNB) is a decentralized and non-custodial asset bridge, which you can read more about [here](https://celer.network/).

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to bridge TBNB and tBUSD from Binance Smart Chain (BSC) over to PepeSync!

Before you begin, ensure your wallet is [configured to use PepeSync](/use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx).

## Add BSC testnet to your MetaMask wallet

First, we'll need to add BSC testnet to our MetaMask wallet. We can easily do so by heading over to [chainlist.wtf](https://chainlist.wtf/). Then, search for Binance Smart Chain. Finally, click `Connect Wallet` and then click `Add Chain` for the Binance Smart Chain Testnet with chain ID 97.

You should now see the test network in your MetaMask wallet.

## Get TBNB

Now that the network is added, we can head over to the PepeSync faucet, to get BNB. To do so:

1. Navigate to the [PepeSync faucet](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/)
1. Connect your wallet and switch to the PepeSync Goerli test network
1. Go to the [BNB faucet](https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart) linked through the BNB card

1. Complete a captcha
1. Input your wallet address and dispense 0.1 TBNB

After it's been dispensed, you should be able to see it in your MetaMask wallet.

To bridge over TBNB, you'll need to:

1. Navigate to the [Celer bridge](https://dev-cbridge-v2.netlify.app/97/59140/BNB)
1. Connect your wallet and change to the BSC test network
1. Make sure the "From" chain is BSC testnet, the "To" chain is PepeSync, and the desired token is BNB

1. Put the desired amount in the "Send" field. Make sure you have enough TBNB to cover the gas fee. Note that you need to prefix decimal values with `0.` like `0.1` to indicate a real number.
1. Click on and confirm transfer

1. Confirm the transaction in the MetaMask pop up

Your transaction should now be sent! You may have to wait a few minutes before the transaction and bridging have been finalized.

Before you get BUSD, make sure you've [added BSC testnet to your wallet](#add-bsc-testnet-to-your-metamask-wallet). Then, you should:
