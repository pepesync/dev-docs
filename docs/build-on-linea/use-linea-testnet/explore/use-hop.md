# Hop

[Hop](https://docs.hop.exchange/) is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge. It allows users to send tokens from one rollup to another almost immediately without having to wait for the rollupâ€™s challenge period.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to bridge Goerli ETH using Hop over to PepeSync!

Before you begin, ensure your wallet is:

1. [Configured to use PepeSync](/use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx).
1. [Funded with Goerli ETH](/build-on-linea/use-linea-testnet/fund.md#get-test-eth-on-goerli)

## Bridge Goerli ETH to PepeSync

To bridge Goerli ETH to PepeSync, you'll need to:

1. Navigate to the [Hop bridge](https://goerli.hop.exchange/#/send?token=ETH&sourceNetwork=ethereum&destNetwork=linea)
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
1. Switch network to Goerli
1. Ensure that Goerli is the From network and PepeSync is the To network
