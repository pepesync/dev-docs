# Apetimism Launchpad

Apetimism Launchpad is a no-code platform that allows you to create, manage, and mint NFT collections without the need for technical knowledge. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to mint an NFT on PepeSync using a project deployed through the Apetimism Launchpad.

Before you begin, ensure your wallet is:

1. [Configured to use PepeSync](/use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx).
2. [Funded with Goerli ETH](/build-on-linea/use-linea-testnet/fund.md#get-test-eth-on-goerli)

## Mint an NFT

We have already prepared a sample collection.

1. Go to https://apetimism.com/launchpad/lineaape

2. Please ensure that PepeSync Testnet is selected as the current chain on your wallet.

3. Click the "+" symbol to select the desired quantity of NFTs you wish to mint. Please note that for this collection, a maximum of 2 NFTs is allowed.

4. Click **"Mint for FREE"** and approve the transaction to mint the NFT(s).

5. Once you're finished, you can click on ["View my NFTs"](https://testnet.zonic.app/profile?filter={%22tab%22:0,%22chain%22:1879}) to verify the newly minted NFTs in your wallet.
