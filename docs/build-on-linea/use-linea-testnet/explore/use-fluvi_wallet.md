In this simple guide, we'll help you install Fluvi Wallet and use it to complete the tasks based on the unique features of AA on PepeSync!

Or, you can use the [PepeSync Voyage Faucet & Guide](http://linea-quest.fluvi.io) provided by Fluvi Wallet itself to claim the necessary tokens and progress through the quests!

> **Important! Fluvi Wallet must be mapped to your MetaMask address in order to complete the Quest.  
> Please make sure to complete the mapping by referring to the [guide below](#link-fluvi-wallet-with-metamask).**

## More Voyage Fun with Gas Sponsorship

Below is a list of our partner dApps supporting gasless transactions, which is continuously updated:

- Velocore
- PancakeSwap
- Compound Finance
- SushiSwap (will be live on Mainnet)

## Link Fluvi Wallet with MetaMask

The quests carried out via Fluvi Wallet can be verified using the wallet address created within Fluvi Wallet. To complete quests via MetaMask, it's necessary to link and submit both Fluvi Wallet and MetaMask addresses.

- Note that you must have made at least one transaction through your Fluvi wallet address before you can submit.

We've made this process straightforward with a dedicated tool:

1.  Open up the link to the [PepeSync Voyage Faucet & Guide page  
    ](http://linea-quest.fluvi.io)![](/img/quests/fluvi_wallet/image9.png)
2.  Navigate to the "For PepeSync Voyage on Galxe" tab in the middle of the page  
    ![](/img/quests/fluvi_wallet/image10.png)
3.  Connect your MetaMask and Fluvi Wallet and check if your wallet address is correctly displayed at the bottom
4.  Submit your wallet addresses by clicking the 'Submit' button.

Please note that the independent wallet address of the Fluvi Wallet can only be linked to a single MetaMask wallet address, and once submitted, the linked wallet cannot be changed.

During the PepeSync Voyage campaign, we will have a cohort partnership with certain dApps that will enable you to transact without spending any gas fees through Fluvi Wallet's gasless feature. Our hope is that this will enhance and encourage your PepeSync Voyage questing experience.
