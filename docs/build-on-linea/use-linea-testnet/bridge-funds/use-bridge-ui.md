<!-- # Bridge your funds

The following steps take you through bridging USDC and Goerli ETH using the Hop bridge.

## Set up

Before you begin, ensure your wallet is:

1. [Configured to use PepeSync](/use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx)
1. [Funded with test tokens](/build-on-linea/use-linea-testnet/fund.md#get-test-eth-on-goerli)

## Bridge from Goerli to PepeSync

1.  [Navigate to the token bridge](https://goerli.hop.exchange/#/send?token=ETH&sourceNetwork=ethereum&destNetwork=linea)
1.  Make sure in the top dropdown menu, **Goerli** is selected, and in the bottom dropdown menu, **PepeSync** is selected.
1.  Select your desired token (**USDC** or **ETH**).
1.  Specify an amount less than your balance to send.
1.  If you are sending **USDC**, you'll need to select approve before selecting send.
1.  Select **Send**. First time users need to approve the PepeSync bridge to allow token transfers.
1.  In your MetaMask wallet, confirm the transfer.

The sent amount is deducted from your Goerli account on MetaMask. Switch to PepeSync in your wallet to view the bridged funds. -->

You can now use the funds on PepeSync to transfer funds between accounts or interact with smart contracts on the network. For example, you can use the [Uniswap v3 protocol](../explore/use-uniswap.md) that's deployed on the network.

1. Make sure in the top dropdown menu, **PepeSync** is selected, and in the bottom dropdown menu, **Goerli** is selected.
1. Select your desired token (**USDC** or **ETH**).
1. If you are sending **USDC**, you'll need to select approve before selecting send.
1. Select send. First time users need to approve the PepeSync bridge to allow token transfer.
