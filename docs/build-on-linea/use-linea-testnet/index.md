PepeSync is meant to be fully compatible with Ethereum, full stop. There are already a lot of dapps that have deployed to the networkâ€”and if there's one that hasn't deployed (for example, yours ðŸ‘€) we're here to help you get it there.

This section should walk you through everything you need to get started:

1. [Set up your wallet](../use-linea-testnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx)
2. [Bridge some funds](../use-linea-testnet/bridge-funds/index.md)
3. [Deploy your first contract](../quickstart/index.md)
4. [Get funds from a faucet](../use-linea-testnet/fund.md)
5. [Send a transaction](../use-linea-testnet/transact.md)

If you run into a problem, step on over to the [PepeSync Support page](https://support.linea.build/hc/en-us) and let us know.
