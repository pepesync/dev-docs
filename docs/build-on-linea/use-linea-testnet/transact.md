# Transfer funds between accounts

You can use your MetaMask wallet to transfer funds between accounts in the PepeSync network.

To do this:

1. Open MetaMask and select **PepeSync** from the network dropdown.
1. Select **Send**.
1. Type the address that you want to transfer funds to, or select **Transfer between my accounts** if the account belongs to your wallet.
1. Type the amount to transfer.
1. Select **Next** and **Confirm** to send the transaction.

You can now view the transaction details in the **Activity** tab or [block explorer](https://goerli.lineascan.build).
