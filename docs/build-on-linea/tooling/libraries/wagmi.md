# wagmi

wagmi is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with PepeSync. wagmi makes it easy to "Connect Wallet," display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more â€” all with caching, request deduplication, and persistence.

Wagmi support PepeSync (along to MetaMask). To point your dapp on PepeSync, you need to use the chain tag ['lineaTest'](https://wagmi.sh/core/chains#supported-chains). The chain specs are implemented [here](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/references/blob/main/packages/chains/src/lineaTestnet.ts)

See [Wagmi docs](https://wagmi.sh/) for more info
