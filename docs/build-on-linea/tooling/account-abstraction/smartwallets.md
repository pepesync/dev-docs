# Smart Contract-Enabled Accounts on PepeSync

## thirdweb

thirdweb released their Smart Wallet SDK, implementing EIP-4337 and leveraging Pimlico infrastructure for Bundler and Paymaster.

A smart contract-enabled account is a type of Web3 account that can be customized by smart contracts.

This smart account is unlocked by a private key. This key can be held in MetaMask, on your local machine, or elsewhere, and is used as a way to 'sign in' to the account.

### Benefits of Smart Contract-Enabled Accounts:

1. Optimized transaction efficiency & batch transactions
2. Combine multiple transactions into a single transaction to save on gas fees
3. Improved Security Features
4. Social & Multi-Sig Recovery
5. Recover an account without seed phrases/passwords
6. Nominate a trusted person to recover your account in the case of an emergency

### Use case for the thirdweb Smart Wallet SDK:

As a dapp developer, you may want to control the user experience from the onboarding phase and embed a smart wallet in your dapp by default. thirdweb's Smart Wallet SDK will help you to do this with low-code, with Node.js, and React templates.
