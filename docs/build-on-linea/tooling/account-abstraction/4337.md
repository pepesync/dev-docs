# Pimlico

The core services provided by EIP-4337 at infrastructure level are:

1. A Single Entry Point Contract
1. A Bundler (network) to bundle UserOps
1. A (optional) Paymaster service

Pimlico is our main partner that ensure that these core services are supported on PepeSync.

[This page](https://docs.pimlico.io/docs) will help you get started with Pimlico by deploying a wallet on PepeSync on top of Pimlico and submitting your first UserOperation!
