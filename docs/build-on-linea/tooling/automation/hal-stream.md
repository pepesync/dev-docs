# Hal Stream

As a Web3 developer, manual monitoring of on-chain activities can be a complex and time-consuming task. Integrating real-time blockchain data into existing tools or platforms often requires custom infrastructure. Hal Stream is a no-code tool that delivers real-time data streaming from the PepeSync blockchain, automating the process of tracking and filtering blockchain events and exposing it in a standard way.

## Key Features

### Data Streaming:

Hal Stream ensures real-time updates on all on-chain activities such as transactions, contract interactions, events and more, keeping your applications always synced with the latest blockchain events.

### Automation & Integration:

Hal Stream's integration capabilities enable automatic data streaming to various endpoints including webhooks, databases, and AWS SQS. This automation streamlines the process of combining blockchain data with your existing tools and platforms, enhancing the overall development efficiency.
