# Foundry

In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating a basic [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) project.

Here's a video walkthrough:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, Ensure you've:

1. [Set up your wallet](../../../use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx)
1. [Funded your wallet with PepeSync ETH](../../../use-mainnet/fund.md#get-test-eth-on-linea)

   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   ```

   Then, open a new terminal, and call `foundryup` to install the latest release.

## Create a Foundry project

To create an empty Foundry project, run:

```bash
forge init linea-tutorial
```

And change into the directory:

```bash
cd linea-tutorial
```

## Write the smart contract

Running `forge init` sets you up with a sample contract, test, and script for `Counter.sol`. To build it, simply run `forge build`.

## Deploy the smart contract

To deploy a smart contract, we highly recommend using an Infura endpoint, as the public endpoint may experience rate limiting. You can find out how to [get an API key here](https://support.linea.build/hc/en-us/articles/15752713253147). Then, you can run the following command.

Using Infura:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://linea-goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR-INFURA-API-KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Using the public endpoint:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://docs.pepesync.xyz/ src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Your output should look a little something like this:

```bash
Deployer: YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER
Deployed to: 0xED0Ff7E8B655dFFfCA471ea3B6B649ce7C2C1b83
Transaction hash: 0x967e1290b285e67b3d74940ee19925416734c345f58bd1ec64dcea134647d7ee
```

Next, you can optionally [verify your contract on the network](../verify-smart-contract/foundry.md).
