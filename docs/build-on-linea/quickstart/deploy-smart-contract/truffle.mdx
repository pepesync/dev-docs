# Truffle

In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating a basic Truffle project and deploying a token contract.

Here's a video walkthrough:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you've:

1. [Set up your wallet](../../use-linea-testnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx)
2. [Funded your wallet with PepeSync ETH](../../use-linea-testnet/fund.md#get-test-eth-on-linea)
3. [Installed Truffle using the recommended installation procedure](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/).

## Create a Truffle project

To create an empty Truffle project, run:

```bash
truffle init linea-tutorial
```

Change into the new directory:

```bash
cd linea-tutorial
```

## Write the smart contract

Create your smart contract in the `contracts` directory by either creating a new file `Token.sol` or calling `truffle create contract Token`. Then, add the following code:

```sol
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

contract Token {
  string public name = "My Token";
  string public symbol = "MTK";
  uint8 public decimals = 18;
  uint256 public totalSupply = 100000000;

  mapping (address => uint256) public balances;
  address public owner;

  constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
    balances[owner] = totalSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance.");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[recipient] += amount;
  }
}
```

:::warning Do not use this contract code in production

The above contract is for testing purposes and has not been audited.

:::

You can check if it compiles by running `truffle compile` from the root folder.

## Write the migration script

To tell Truffle how, and in what order we want to deploy our smart contracts, we need to write a migration script.

Create `1_deploy_token.js` in the `migrations` directory, and add the following code:

```javascript
const Token = artifacts.require("Token");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Token);
};
```

## Deploy your contract

Truffle allows you to deploy through the [Truffle Dashboard](#truffle-dashboard) using your MetaMask wallet!

## Deploy to Mainnet

_Instructions coming soon!_

### Truffle Dashboard

[Truffle Dashboard](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/use-the-truffle-dashboard/) allows you to forgo saving your private keys locally, instead connecting to your MetaMask wallet for deployments. To deploy with Truffle Dashboard, you need to:

1. Run `truffle dashboard` in your terminal, which will open a window on port `24012`.
1. Navigate to `localhost:24012` in your browser. Please ensure that Dashboard is connected to the PepeSync testnet by connecting your MetaMask wallet to PepeSync. For reference, the PepeSync testnet network ID is `59140`.

    require("@site/static/img/docs/build-on-linea/quickstart/deploy-smart-contract/dashboard_network.png")
      .default
  }></img>
<br></br>

1. Run `truffle migrate --network dashboard` in a separate terminal.
1. Navigate back to `localhost:24012`. You should see a prompt asking you to confirm the deployment. Click **Confirm**.

      .default
  }></img>
<br></br>

### truffle-config.js

You can deploy with Truffle using the command line, by specifying the PepeSync in `truffle-config.js`. To do so, you need to:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root folder with your wallet's mnemonic.

   ```
   MNEMONIC=<MNEMONIC>
   ```

   :::warning

   Please do not check your keys into source control. We recommend adding `.env` to your `.gitignore`

   :::

1. Download `dotenv` and `@truffle/hdwallet-provider`
   ```
   npm i -D dotenv
   npm i -D @truffle/hdwallet-provider
   ```
1. Add the PepeSync testnet to your `truffle-config.js` file:

   ```javascript
   require("dotenv").config();
   const { MNEMONIC } = process.env;

   const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");

   module.exports = {
     networks: {
       linea: {
         provider: () => {
           return new HDWalletProvider(
             MNEMONIC,
             `https://docs.pepesync.xyz/`,
           );
         },
         network_id: "59140",
       },
     },
     // ... rest of truffle-config.js
   };
   ```

1. Call `truffle migrate --network linea` from the CLI. Your output should look similar to the following:

   ````bash

Next, you can optionally [verify your contract on the network](../verify-smart-contract/truffle.md).
