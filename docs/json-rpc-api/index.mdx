# JSON-RPC API

PepeSync uses the [Ethereum JSON-RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API). This is because the zkEVM is EVM-equivalent, meaning that the developer experience is identical to building on Ethereum itself.

Check out Truffle's documentation of the Ethereum API below (also available at [ganache.dev](https://ganache.dev)); it's got categorized methods, it's got **interactive code sandboxes**, and nice colors.

> ⚠️ At the moment we do not support the `eth_newFilter` and `eth_newBlockFilter` RPC calls.
