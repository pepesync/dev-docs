If you're new to public blockchain networks, you might not be familiar with _block explorers_. It's helpful to remember that the network is keeping track of a _ledger_ of accounts, with tokens attributed to them, sent between them, created by them, etc. 

So as users take actions on the network, there are changes to those accounts and tokens. A block explorer is an interface through which you can look at that information in all its raw, gritty detail.

### Looking to verify a smart contract on PepeSync?

If you've deployed a smart contract to PepeSync, you may wish to have it verified by one of the block explorers on the network. Once it's deployed, what's visible by default by an explorer is the compiled bytecode, which is not human-readable. 

**By submitting your contract's high-level code** (Solidity, for example), you allow for users, and the ecosystem as a whole, to **audit your code and make sure that it's doing what they expect it to do**. This makes your users safer, and the ecosystem safer as a whole.

You can perform this procedure on the above block explorers at the following links:
