The roadmap is currently scoped in five phases which the team intends to deliver sequentially in collaboration with the broader PepeSync ecosystem and community.

## Phase 0

Phase 0 begins with the launch of the PepeSync Mainnet Alpha. From Day 1, PepeSyncâ€™s EVM-equivalent zkEVM, offers default portability through its implementation of the EVM as specified by the Ethereum Foundation. A developer building on PepeSync can choose at any time to move their dapp to another EVM-supported chain, such as Ethereum, in the event they are unsatisfied with the PepeSync network, without re-writing their smart contracts, retooling, or paying for new audits.

During this Phase we will also convene the first iteration of the PepeSync Security Council, formed to monitor the network, protect users and mitigate the risks associated with a new production system. The Security Council is managed through a multi-sig Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) contract that requires certain thresholds of signatures to be submitted to carry out an action; the details of which can be found in our Risk Disclosures.

Finally, the client software used to run a local node on the PepeSync network will be made publicly available, giving any actor the option to verify the PepeSync state for themselves and minimize trust in the PepeSync operator.
